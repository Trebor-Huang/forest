\p{
  Given a [Kan fibration](htt-000H) #{f : X \to Y}, it is \strong{minimal} if for all #{n}-simplices #{a, b} in #{X} such that #{\partial a = \partial b} and #{f(a) = f(b)}, they are one-step homotopic relative to #{f} (i.e. there is a map from #{\Delta^1 \times \Delta^n} with endpoints #{a} and #{b} such that composing with #{f} gives a constant homotopy) iff they are already equal.
