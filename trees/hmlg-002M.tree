\p{
  The [#{\delta}-functors](hmlg-002K) between two [abelian categories](hmlg-000G) form a displayed category over the category of [additive functors](hmlg-000S) (or we can restrict it to [right exact functors](hmlg-000X) for homological #{\delta}-functors). Under this setup, the definition of a [[hmlg-002N]] can be expressed abstractly as a “relative” kind of terminal object or initial object. It is an object #{X} displayed over #{x} such that #{\hom_f (Y, X) = 1} for every #{Y} and #{f}.
