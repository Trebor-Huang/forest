\p{
  Given two chain complexes #{C_\bullet} and #{D_\bullet} with two [chain maps](hmlg-0008) #{f, g : C \to D} between them, a \strong{chain homotopy} from #{f} to #{g} is given by a family of maps #{h_n : C_n \to D_{n+1}}, such that
  ##{d_{n+1} \compose h_n + h_{n-1} \compose d_n = f_n - g_n.}
  Note that the two #{d}â€™s denote the boundary map of different chain complexes.
}

\p{
  The chain homotopy can be written as #{h : f \to g} or as #{h : C \to D}. This causes no confusion, and the latter is convenient in situations where the maps #{f, g} matter less than their difference #{f - g}.
}
