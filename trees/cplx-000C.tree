\taxon{Theorem}

\p{
  A bounded holomorphic function #{f} defined on the entire complex plane must be constant.
}

\proof{
  \p{
    Consider the integral formulas for derivatives in \ref{cplx-000B}
    ##{f'(z) = \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \int_\gamma \frac{f(w)}{(w - z)^2} \dif{w},}
    where #{\gamma} is some circle of radius #{r} enclosing #{z}. Since #{f(w)} is bounded, the integrand is bounded by #{C r^{-2}} for some constant #{C}. But this means the derivative is bounded by #{O(r^{-1})}. Since the function is holomorphic on the entire plane, #{r} can be arbitrary large, which means #{f'(z) = 0}.
  }

  \p{
    When #{f} is not defined on the entire plane, this method still gives an upper bound on the magnitude of the derivative ##{|f^{(n)} (z)| \le M n! \cdot r^{-n}.} This is known as the \strong{Cauchy estimate}.
