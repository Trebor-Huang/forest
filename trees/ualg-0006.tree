\p{
  An object of [[ualg-0004]] can be considered as a [free algebra](ualg-0003), but \mark{equipped with a canonical choice of generators}. Hence although [[ualg-0005]], the objects are essentially different. This manifests as the curious fact that the Kleisli category is not univalent, since an equality of Kleisli objects requires an isomorphism of the generators, but an isomorphism only requires the two free algebras to be isomorphic.
