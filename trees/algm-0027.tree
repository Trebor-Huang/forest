\p{
  A [[algm-0025]] is cartesian closed iff the left adjoint #{\realize} preserves binary products.
}

\proof{
  \p{
    If the total category #{\CatVar{C}} is cartesian closed, then
    ##{\hom(F, \yo(A^B)) = \hom(\realize(F), A^B) = \hom(\realize(F) \times B, A).}
    On the other hand, #{\yo} preserves exponentials, and therefore
    ##{\begin{aligned}
      \hom(F, \yo(A^B)) &= \hom(F, \yo(A)^{\yo(B)}) \\
      &= \hom(F \times \yo(B), \yo(A)) \\
      &= \hom(\realize(F \times \yo(B)), A).
    \end{aligned}}
    Hence we need the canonical map
    ##{\realize(F \times \yo(B)) \to \realize(F) \times \realize(\yo(B)) \to \realize(F) \times B}
    to be an isomorphism. But the counit #{\realize(\yo(B)) \to B} is already an isomorphism since #{\yo} is a fully faithful right adjoint. Therefore this happens iff #{\realize(F \times G) \to \realize(F) \times \realize(G)} is an isomorphism for all representable presheaves #{G}. Now presheaves are (large) colimits of representables, and being left adjoints, both #{\realize} and binary products preserve all colimits whatsoever. So we can extend this to all presheaves #{G}.
  }

  \p{
    On the other hand, if #{\realize} preserves binary products, then #{(A \times -)} must be cocontinuous: Every small colimit diagram #{D : I \to \CatVar{C}} can be [equivalently represented](algm-0026) as a presheaf #{F = \colim_{i \in I} \yo D(i)} with colimit #{\realize(F)}. The presheaf for the product diagram #{A \times D(i)} is #{\colim_{i \in I} \yo(A \times D(i))}, which is equivalent to #{F \times \yo(A)}, since #{\yo} preserves product and product is cocontinuous in presheaves.
    (A naive way to construct the presheaf for the product diagram is #{F \compose (A \times -)}, but this doesnâ€™t quite work because of contravariance.)
    We have #{\realize(F \times \yo(A)) = \realize(F) \times A}, showing cocontinuity.
    Therefore by the [[algm-0029]], we know exponentials must exist.
