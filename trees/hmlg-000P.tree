\p{
  Let #{\CatVar{C}} be [#{\Cat{Ab}}-enriched](hmlg-000O). The finite products and coproducts, if they exist, are isomorphic via a canonical map. If they all exist, then this category is called an \strong{additive category}. In particular, the nullary product and coproduct coincide, and we call the object \strong{zero object}, denoted #{0}.
