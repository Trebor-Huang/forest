\p{
  Although we make an analogy between a [[hmlg-001N]] and a vector field, the [field lines](hmlg-001Q) of a DVF may branch out. For instance, take a triangle #{\tau} with three edges #{\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \sigma_3}. We can have a vector #{\Vec{\sigma_1 \tau}} pointing into the triangle, and #{\sigma_2, \sigma_3} each having vectors pointing out. Similarly multiple field lines may join when they reach a lower-degree cell. Because of this, we need to take care in the phrasing of [admissibility](hmlg-001P).
