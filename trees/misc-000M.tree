\p{
  A regular language is \strong{reversible} if it can be recognized by a [bideterministic](misc-000L) DFA, which is equivalent to requiring the [[misc-000K]] to be bideterministic.
}

\p{
  Note that there are stronger and weaker notions of reversible regular languages in the literature, with inconsistent names.
}
