\title{dense subsite of affine opens}
\author{trebor}
\import{common}

\p{
  Given a [[algm-000R]] #{S}, the underlying locale (equipped with the canonical coverage) has a [[algm-0021]] whose objects are affine opens, and morphisms are distinguished open subspaces. Note that this isnâ€™t a full subcategory, since [there exist affine open subspaces that are not distinguished](algm-0020).
}

\p{
  Since schemes are covered by affine schemes, and distinguished opens form a basis in the [[algm-0007]], every open in #{S} is covered by affine opens. On the other hand, [[algm-0016]] guarantees the condition on morphisms for dense subsites.
