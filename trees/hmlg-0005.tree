\p{
  [Projective objects](hmlg-0004) are defined to capture a key property of free objects. For an arbitrary abelian group #{P}, lifting a map #{P \to B} through an epimorphism requires us to pick a lifting for every generator, such that the relations between the generators still hold after lifting. If such a thing can always be done, then we may say that the relations, or tangling between generators are practically non-existent. A projective object can thus be reguarded as generated by some elements with zero or undetectable “tangling”.
