\p{
  There is a natural (differential graded) coalgebra structure on [algebraic cellular complexes](hmlg-0013). Recall that the tensor unit is #{\mathbb{Z}} concentrated at degree 0. The counit map sends every 0-dimensional cell to #{1}, and everything else to zero. The comultiplication is induced by the composition (... need simplicial?)
