\p{
  Given a category #{\CatVar{C}} with a [[algm-001A]] #{J} and a sheaf #{F}, there is a Grothendieck coverage #{J'} on #{\int_{\CatVar{C}} F} such that the equivalence in \ref{algm-001T} restricts to an equivalence
  ##{\Cat{Sh}(\CatVar{C}, J)/F \cong \Cat{Sh}\left(\int_{\CatVar{C}} F, J'\right).}
}

\proof{
  \p{
    Suppose we have a covering sieve #{S \include \yo(U)} in #{\CatVar{C}}, then an element #{f \in \section(U, F)} uniquely corresponds to a matching family #{s \in \hom(S, F)}. In the category of elements #{\int_{\CatVar{C}} F}, #{s} corresponds to a sieve over #{f}. This is the required Grothendieck coverage.
  }

  \p{
    Another way to construct this is through the [[algm-001L]] #{j}. The subobject classifier of a slice category is simply #{\Omega \times F \to F}. Hence we can let #{j} act on the #{\Omega} factor. This gives a Lawvereâ€“Tierney operator on the slice category and it coincides with the Grothendieck coverage constructed above.
