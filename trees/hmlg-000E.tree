\p{
  Although the definition of exactness and acyclicity are the same, they have different [attitudes](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/concept+with+an+attitude). Acyclicity reguards the chain complex as a geometric object, concerning cycles and boundaries. On the other hand, exactness takes a purely algebraic perspective, describing how the algebraic pieces fit together.
