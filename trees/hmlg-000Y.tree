\title{equalizers can be reduced to kernels in #{\Cat{Ab}}-enriched categories}
\taxon{theorem}

\p{
  We can express equalizers with kernels (which are equalizers with the zero morphism).
}

\proof{
  \p{
    We simply need to note that an equalizer for #{f} and #{g} is equivalent to an equalizer for #{(f-g)} and #{0}, by bilinearity of composition.
  }
}
