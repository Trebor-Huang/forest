\p{
  Given a category #{\CatVar{C}} equipped with a [[algm-0019]], we define a presheaf #{P : \CatVar{C}^\op \to \Set} to be a \strong{sheaf} if it satisfies the \strong{sheaf condition}: for every cover of #{A}, the map from sections of #{A} to [descent data](algm-001D) of the cover is a bijection. It is a \strong{separated presheaf} if the map is an injection.
