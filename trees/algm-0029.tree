\p{
  Given any cocontinuous functor #{F} from a [[algm-0025]] #{\CatVar{C}} to a locally small category #{\CatVar{D}}, it has a right adjoint without additional assumptions.
}

\proof{
  \p{
    The idea of the adjoint functor theorem is to construct the large colimit
    ##{G(X) = \colim_{FY \to X} Y.}
    But this is exactly the kind of colimits mentioned in \ref{algm-0025}.
    We can construct the right adjoint by letting #{G(X) = L(F^* \yo(X))}.
  }
