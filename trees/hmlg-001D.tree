\p{
  An ACC can be viewed as the algebraic distillation of a [chain complex](hmlg-0002). The generators in dimension #{n} are regarded as #{n}-cells. However, we only record a formal sum of the boundaries, and forget the exact configuration. Hence, ACC is a suitable middle ground for both geometric transformations and algebraic operations.
