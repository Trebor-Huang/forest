\p{
  Given a [[hmlg-001N]], if is \strong{admissible} if the lengths of the [field lines](hmlg-001Q) starting from a cell are bounded. In other words, we can assign a natural number to every cell such that the field lines starting from this cell have length bounded by the number. The number can be different for each cell, and can be unbounded overall.
