\p{
  The word compactness historically required the space to be Hausdorff. And the modern meaning of compactness was called quasi-compact. In algebraic geometry, most spaces are never Hausdorff, and the topological compactness condition does not lead to similar behavior. There is another notion more suitable as an analog of topological compactness. Therefore, we choose to always use the word “quasi-compact”.
