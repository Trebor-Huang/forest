\p{
  The \strong{sphere} #{\mathbb{S}^n} can be constructed as an [[hmlg-001T]] with exactly two geometric simplices: a zero-dimensional point, and an #{n}-dimensional surface. All the faces of the surface are degenerate and comes from the point.
}

\p{
  The [associated reduced ACC](hmlg-001U) is #{\mathbb{Z}} at degree #{0} and #{n} and zero elsewhere. The map #{d} is constant zero.
