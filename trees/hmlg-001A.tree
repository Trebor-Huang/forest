\p{
  Given an [[hmlg-0013]], suppose we can encode the basis sets #{C_\bullet} such that they have [decidable equality](todo), and the maps #{C_k \to \mathbb{Z}[C_{k-1}]} are computable, then we say the ACC is \strong{effective}. Suppose further that #{C_\bullet} are (computably) finite sets, then we say it is \strong{effective of finite type}.
