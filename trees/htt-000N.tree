\taxon{theorem}

\p{
  We have several [weak factorization systems](htt-000K) in the category of simplicial sets.
}
\ul{
  \li{[Anodyne maps](htt-000H) and [Kan fibrations](htt-000H).}
  \li{Left/right anodyne maps and left/right fibrations.}
  \li{Monomorphisms and [trivial fibrations](htt-000M).}
