\p{
  Given a locally small category #{\CatVar{C}}, the yoneda embedding #{\yo : \CatVar{C} \to \Cat{Psh}(\CatVar{C})} has four consecutive left adjoints iff #{\CatVar{C}} is equivalent to #{\Set}. See \ref{algm-002A} and \ref{algm-002B} for examples with one and two left adjoints, and \ref{algm-002C} for the four consecutive left adjoint over #{\Set}.
