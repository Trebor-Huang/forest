# Forester theme

This is a fork of the [base theme](https://git.sr.ht/~jonsterling/forester-base-theme) for my personal use.

The `link-external` and `edit` icons comes from [codicon](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-codicons), under the MIT License.

I'm using a forked version of KaTeX temporarily, before [#3133](https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX/pull/3133) is merged.
